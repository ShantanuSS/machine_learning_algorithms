NLP stands for natural language processing

It is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.

Natural language refers to the way we, humans, communicate with each other.

Namely, speech and text.

We are surrounded by text.


Basically,
Natural Language Processing or NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages.

And 

Natural language means a human language. For example, English, French, and Chinese are natural languages. Computer languages, such as FORTRAN and C, are not. Probably the single most challenging problem in computer science is to develop computers that can understand natural languages.
